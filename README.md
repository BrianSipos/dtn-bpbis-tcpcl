# Demo Convergence Layer Agent

The demo TCPCL agent implements the corresponding specification draft.
A TCPCL agent is symmetric, there is no notion of a single agent being a "server" or a "client".
The demo agent hosted here has an optional startup action, which is to either listen on an address+port (act as a passive node in a TCPCL session) or to connect to an address+port (act as an active node in a TCPCL session).
Once the agent is started, regardless of which or if a startup action was given, the agent can be commanded via D-Bus to listen/connect for later sessions or to transport bundles over existing sessions.

## Starting the Agent

An insecure session on the `localhost` address can be established with commands:
```
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m tcpcl.agent --bus-service=tcpcl.Server --eid=server --tls-disable listen --address=localhost
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m tcpcl.agent --bus-service=tcpcl.Client --eid=client --tls-disable connect localhost
```

To use Fedora/CentOS7 system-default localhost PKI use:
```
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m tcpcl.agent --bus-service=tcpcl.Server --eid=server --tls-key=/etc/pki/tls/private/localhost.key --tls-cert=/etc/pki/tls/certs/localhost.crt listen --address=localhost
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m tcpcl.agent --bus-service=tcpcl.Client --eid=client --tls-key=/etc/pki/tls/private/localhost.key --tls-cert=/etc/pki/tls/certs/localhost.crt connect localhost
```

## Commanding the Agent
The agent can be accessed via D-Bus based on the `bus-service` name given on the command line.

### Agent Interface

The agent itself is accessible via the object `/org/ietf/dtn/tcpcl/Agent` with interface `org.ietf.dtn.tcpcl.Agent`.

The methods in this interface are:

- `listen(address, port)` to cause the agent to listen on a given port.
- `listen_stop(address, port)` to cause the agent to stop listening.
- `connect(address, port)` to cause the agent to attempt a connection to a peer.
- `shutdown()` causes any open sessions to be terminated, which itself may wait on in-progress transfers to complete. The return value is `True` if the agent stopped immediately, or `False` if sessions are being waited on before stopping.
- `stop()` forces the process to exit immediately and not wait.

The signals in this interface are:

- `connection_opened(path)` is emitted when a new TCP connection is opened and session negotiation begins. This does not mean the session is established and ready for use, just that a session may be established on the new connection.
- `connection_closed(path)` is emitted when a TCP connection is closed.

### Session Interface

Each established session is accessible via the object `/org/ietf/dtn/tcpcl/Contact{N}`, where `{N}` is some unique identifier number, with interface `org.ietf.dtn.tcpcl.Contact`.

Notable methods in this interface are:

- `is_sess_idle()` which returns true when the session is established, ready for use, and no messages are being sent or recevied.
- `is_secure()` which returns true if TLS is used to secure the session.
- `send_bundle_get_queue()` which returns Transfer IDs which are queued for sending.
- `send_bundle_file(filepath)` which queues transfer of a file directly from the filesystem. The agent must have sufficient permission to read from the file. The return value is the new Transfer ID.
- `send_bundle_data(bytes)` which queues transfer of data from the message itself. The return value is the new Transfer ID.
- `recv_bundle_get_queue()` which returns the Transfer IDs which have been received and are ready.
- `recv_bundle_pop_file(bid, filepath)` which takes a received transfer directly into the filesystem. The `bid` argument is the Transfer ID to pop. The agent must have sufficient permission to write to the file.
- `recv_bundle_pop_data(bid)` which takes a received transfer and returns its contents as a byte array. The `bid` argument is the Transfer ID to pop. The return value is the transfer data itself.
- `terminate(reason_code)` which performs the session termination procedure, which waits for any in-progress transfers to complete then closes the TCP connection.
- `close()` which closes the TCP connection immediately.

Files can be sent with commands similar to:
```
dbus-send --print-reply --dest=tcpcl.Client /org/ietf/dtn/tcpcl/Contact0 org.ietf.dtn.tcpcl.Contact.send_bundle_file string:"/etc/hostname"
```

Files can be popped out of the agent after reception with commands similar to:
```
dbus-send --print-reply --dest=tcpcl.Server /org/ietf/dtn/tcpcl/Contact0 org.ietf.dtn.tcpcl.Contact.recv_bundle_get_queue
```
to get the received Transfer ID, and
```
dbus-send --print-reply --dest=tcpcl.Server /org/ietf/dtn/tcpcl/Contact0 org.ietf.dtn.tcpcl.Contact.recv_bundle_pop_file string:1 string:/tmp/dest
```
to actually save the received bundle.
